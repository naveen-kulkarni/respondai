Create a VPC and subnets with proper network security in place

Create a VPC using Terraform with public and private subnets in different availability zones.
Associate a route table with the public subnet that has a route to the internet gateway. 
Associate a route table with the private subnet that has a route to the NAT gateway. Ensure proper network 
security in place by defining security groups


Deploy EC2 instances and configure them as web servers

Launch EC2 instances using Terraform in the private subnets. 
Install and configure the web server on each instance.
Create an auto scaling group and associate it with the launch configuration. 
Set up health checks for the instances.

Deploy an RDS instance as the database backend
Use ELB to balance traffic between the EC2 instances
Use Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand
Use Route 53 to route traffic to the ELB
Use CloudWatch to monitor the performance of the web application
Use S3 for file storage
Use IAM to control access to AWS resources
